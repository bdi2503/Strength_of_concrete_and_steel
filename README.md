# Strength of concrete and steel
Purpose: To introduce forecasting models into the design phase of structures to select optimal design parameters, saving time and money.
- Based on experimental data (the composition of concrete and steel alloy), a correlation analysis was carried out;
- Built prediction models (regression, random forest model, neural network model) to calculate the strength of concrete and steel;
- Visualized and compared the results;
- By example, it showed how with the help of a model you can quickly determine the appropriate composition of concrete and steel alloy.
